# EZ Dotfiles

## Installing

  ruby activate.rb

## BASH

You get a bash\_profile which simply sources bashrc.

The bashrc is fairly simple. Here are some highlights:

  * Functions for each project: ss, billing-api, billing. Each function gives you a RR environment variable pointing to RAILS\_ROOT and some aliases.
  * Git info in your prompt: branch and an indicator showing whether you have uncommitted changes or not.
  * Path: ~/scripts, /usr/local/mysql/bin and other bits to make MacPorts and system utilities work.
  * Aliases: good stuff like ezlogin, gems, etc.
  * RVM: bash will initialize RVM.

## CRON

## TERMINAL
